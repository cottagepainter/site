      <h1>About Myself</h1>
    </header>

    <p>My name is Currie Carmichael, I&rsquo;m a professional painter who has
been serving the SSCA for the past 4 years.  I specialize in
exterior-repaints of wood and composite-sided houses and buildings.
I have been a cottager in the area my entire life and am prepared,
equipped, and ready to handle any project on the Bay.</p>

<p>My season generally lasts from mid-May until September. I primarily
focus on exterior-work during this time. Although this is the case,
I am more then capable of handling your interior projects. However,
interior projects will be scheduled with less priority then exterior
ones.  The reason for this is simply because exterior work is, generally, much
more profitable then interior work and thus i must take full advantage
of its season. Also, i just enjoy exterior work a lot more.</p>

<p>If you have any doubts about my competence, I&rsquo;ve included, on this
website, my list of <a href="/references">references</a> for
you to consult. <a href="/references">This list</a> contains a
reference for each of my past clients. This is because i am confident
that every job i have undertaken has been completed correctly and professionally.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="/contact">contact</a> me anytime. I do
not charge for estimations.</p>
