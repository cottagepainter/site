      <description>Caulking    Caulk is used to seal gaps and seems between intersecting surfaces (baseboards|walls, trim|walls, &amp;hellip;). Thus, caulking not only helps to insulate your buildings, but is also an important aesthetic process.
Flashing    Light interacting differently with different parts of the same surface creates a discrepancy in it&amp;rsquo;s visual experience. Depending on the amount and direction of the light, flashing can be very [noticible](https://www.google.ca/?gws_rd=ssl#q=paint flashing&amp;amp;tbm=isch).</description>

      <description>Spraying is a basic method of paint-application for the modern painter, forming a trinity with the traditional methods of brushing and rolling.
The main benefit of spraying is speed. A two-story house that used to take 10 days to paint with a brush and roller, can be sprayed in 1 or 2 days by just one person. An incredible productivity boost!
Spraying also leaves the finest finish. Anytime paint is applied with a brush, lap marks, caused by the bristles dragging out the paint, are inevitably left behind and visible to the critical eye.</description>

      <description>Caulking Ladders Masking Spackling Spraying Washing  Caulking    After a couple years of testing, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that Big Stretch is the only caulk worth using. Although it is expensive (~$6.00 a tube), it works where the others failed. This is especially true on the Bay, where buildings are normally old, wooden, and very exposed.

      <title>What is Paint?</title>

      <description>The term paint has become convoluted due to the terminology used by &amp;lsquo;paint&amp;rsquo;-manufactures in their marketing. People use the word &amp;lsquo;paint&amp;rsquo; for anything that you can put on with a brush, hence the verb &amp;lsquo;to paint&amp;rsquo;. The problem is that the &amp;lsquo;paint&amp;rsquo;-industry uses the word &amp;lsquo;paint&amp;rsquo; for a class of its products. It&amp;rsquo;s like a restaurant replacing the word &amp;lsquo;entree&amp;rsquo; with &amp;lsquo;food&amp;rsquo;. As a consequence, people end up calling different things &amp;lsquo;paint&amp;rsquo;, even thou they might differ greatly in function.</description>
