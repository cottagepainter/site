      <description>My name is Currie Carmichael, I&amp;rsquo;m a professional painter who has been serving the SSCA for the past 4 years. I specialize in exterior-repaints of wood and composite-sided houses and buildings. I have been a cottager in the area my entire life and am prepared, equipped, and ready to handle any project on the Bay.
My season generally lasts from mid-May until September. I primarily focus on exterior-work during this time.</description>
