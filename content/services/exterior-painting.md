<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

No paint will perform correctly unless the proper steps are taken to prepare the surface before
application. This process is called **prep**.

1. All surfaces are **washed** with a high-pressure (~3000psi) washer and a rotating nozzle for maximum agitation
2. All loose paint is **scraped** and removed. 
3. All rough surfaces are **sanded**.
4. All cracks and seams are **caulked**
5. All surfaces requiring primer are **primed**.

<h2 id="application">Application</h2>

For the body of the house, I use an 

<h3 id="spraying">Spraying</h3>

**Spraying** is a basic method of paint-application for the modern
painter, forming a trinity with the traditional methods of brushing and
rolling.

The main benefit of spraying is speed. A two-story house that used to
take 10 days with a brush and roller can now be sprayed in 1 or 2 days
by just one person. An incredible productivity boost!

Spraying also leaves the finest finish. Anytime paint is applied with
a brush, lap marks, caused by the bristles dragging out the paint, are
inevitably left behind and visible to the critical eye. Paint applied by
rolling leaves behind stipiling, caused by the indent of the fibers in
the nap.  Spraying, on the otherhand, leaves behind no visible trace of
application. This makes spraying especially ideal when painting smooth
surfaces such as trim or doors.

Spraying is also ideal when dealing with non-flat surfaces like
furniture. Painting these with a brush or roller is extremely error
prone and can take a lot of work to get right. A piece of furniture that
takes 2 hours to brush can be sprayed in under 5 minutes!

<h4 id="overspray">Overspray</h4>

<h5 id="what is overspray?">What is Overspray?</h5>

**Overspray** is any paint applied with a sprayer that __misses__ the intended surface. Care
must always be taken to prevent overspray from getting on the wrong surface (like decks, windows, ...)

<h5 id="controlling overspray">Controlling Overspray</h5>

There are two ways to control overspray: **catching** and
**covering**.

**Catching** is absorbing the overspray at the gun. This is done by using
cardboard shields; using one hand to spray and the other hand, holding the
shield, to __catch__.

**Covering** is absorbing the overspray at the surface you want to protect. This
is done by draping surfaces with drop-clothes, masking them with
paper, or sealing them with tape.

<h4 id="backbrushing">Backbrushing</h4>

Paint applied with a sprayer exists as a rectangular layer on-top of the
surface. When dealing with highly porous surfaces like cedar-siding, it
cannot be expected that the paint will penetrate into the tiny holes
and grooves of the surface. Thus the sprayed-paint must be __pushed__
into those pores to guarantee proper adhesion. This process is called
**backbrushing** and is done with either a brush or a roller.

<h5 id="is it always necessary?">Is it always necessary?</h5>

**No**. If the surface is smooth, then there is no texture in the
surface to push the paint into. Backbrushing in this case would both
ruin your finish and waste your time.
