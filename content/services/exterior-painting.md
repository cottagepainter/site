I offer **modern**, **efficient**, **correct**, **large-scale** exterior painting.
*Modern*; I use the most modern equipment and tools as the basis
of my process. *Efficient*; my process is effective and practiced.
*Correct*; my process is warranty-valid according to the paint
manufacturer. *Large-scale*; my process can handle any size job on the Bay.

All services I provide are offered with a **firm**, **quoted**, **transparent** price. 

My estimation process is very simple. I require two numbers:

1. The **days** it will take to complete the job
2. The **gallons of paint** required

I don't do any fancy measurements to figure out these numbers, just my own gut-feeling tempered with experience.
Once I have them, the quoted price is then derived using the following parameters:

* Boat charge (by day)
* Cost of paint (by gallon)
* Equipment charge (by gallon)
* Labour charge (by day)

Since every job is different, extra charges might be required. However, any such charges will always be made visible on the
estimate.

If the customer agrees to the estimate, a date is then scheduled to begin the painting
process.

All estimates are generated and sent using the [Invoice Simple](https://www.invoicesimple.com/) app.

The first step in the painting process, and arguably the most
important, is making sure that all surfaces are clean. Contaminants
on the surface (such as dirt, dust, mold, and mildew) directly
affect the ability of the paint to bond. The strength of the bond between surface and paint
is what determines the paint's longevity.

I wash all surfaces with a high-pressure (~3000psi) pressure washer
and a [rotating nozzle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZJfXY4LMcA) to maximize agitation. I don't use chemicals.

The washing is typically scheduled a day or two before the main painting process. This is because the
surface must be allowed to completely dry before any more work can be done. The scheduling is
very flexible as the process, usually, doesn't take very long to complete.

Once the surface is washed and dry, it's time to **prep** the surface:

* All loose paint is **scraped**
* All cracks, gaps, and seams are **caulked**
* All surfaces requiring primer are **primed**

**Scraping** is essential because any paint applied to loose paint is not binding to the surface at all, but to the
loose paint. Thus when the loose paint falls off, so does your paint job.

**Caulking** has many benefits. Personally I treat it as an aesthetic process. Yes it can help insulate the building,
but since I'm in the business of painting cottages, buildings which
only see use in the summer, insulation is, generally, not a concern. Caulking
gaps and seams in the building makes it look more integrated and 'together'.

**Priming** is part of the process of preparing the surface to accept the paint. For exterior-painting,
I rarely need to prime since I am normally using [solid-color stains](../../resources/paint#layers), which generally
don't require a primer to bond well to the surface.

The body of the hose is [sprayed](../../resources/spraying). The
trim, if to be painted a different color, is generally brushed or rolled,
otherwise it will be sprayed. The
[soffit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soffit) is sprayed. Any doors
to be painted are sprayed. The [fascia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia_(architecture)) is always brushed or rolled.

Once the painting is complete, I remove all garbage created during the process, pack up my equipment,
and generally try to leave the place better looking then when I arrived.
