I offer **modern**, **efficient**, **correct**, **small-scale** interior painting.
*Modern*; I use the most modern equipment and tools as the basis
of my process. *Efficient*; my process is effective and practiced.
*Correct*; my process is warranty-valid according to the paint
manufacturer. *Small-scale*; my process can handle small jobs (trim-repaints, bedrooms, ...).

{{< headerlink level="3" id="estimation" parent="process" title="Estimation" >}}

All services I provide are offered with a **firm**, **quoted**, **transparent** price. 

My estimation process is very simple. I require two numbers:

1. The **days** it will take to complete the job
2. The **gallons of paint** required

I don't do any fancy measurements to figure out these numbers, just my own gut-feeling tempered with experience.
Once I have them, the quoted price is then derived using the following parameters:

* Boat charge (by day)
* Cost of paint (by gallon)
* Equipment charge (by gallon)
* Labour charge (by day)

Since every job is different, extra charges might be required. However, any such charges will always be made visible on the
estimate.

If the customer agrees to the estimate, a date is then scheduled to begin the painting
process.

All estimates are generated and sent using the [Invoice Simple](https://www.invoicesimple.com/) app.

The first step in the painting process, and arguably the most
important, is making sure that all surfaces are clean. Contaminants
on the surface (such as dirt, dust, mold, and mildew) directly
affect the ability of the paint to bond. The strength of this bond
is what determines the paint's longevity.

I wash all surfaces with a sponge, hot-water, and [Dawn](https://dawn-dish.com/en-us) dish soap.

{{< headerlink level="3" id="preparation" parent="process" title="Preparation" >}}

The **prep** process for interior-painting is a little more involved
then its [exterior counterpart](../exterior-painting#preparation).
This is due to the fact that interior surfaces are, generally, much
smoother then exterior ones, requiring a larger set of imperfections
to be dealt with in order to avoid them becoming accentuated by a
fresh coat of paint.

1. All loose paint is **scraped**. 
2. All nail holes are **spackled** 
3. All cracks, gaps, and seams are **caulked**.
4. All dents are **glazed**.
5. All surfaces requiring primer are **primed**.

**Scraping** is essential because any paint applied to loose paint is not binding to the surface at all, but to the
loose paint. Thus when the loose paint falls off, so does your paint job.

[Caulking](../../resources/glossary#caulking), [Spackling](../../resources/glossary#spackling), and [Glazing](../../resources/glossary#glazing) are about making everything more integrated and 'together'. I caulk places where most other
painters don't; like the gap between the baseboards and the wall.

**Priming** is part of the process of preparing the surface to accept the [top-coat](../../resources/glossary#top-coat). For exterior-painting,
I rarely need to prime since I am normally using solid-color stains, which generally
don't require a primer.

{{< headerlink level="3" id="application" parent="process" title="Application" >}}

Typically, trim and doors are **sprayed**, the walls are **rolled**, and the ceiling is either **sprayed** or **rolled**.

[Spraying](../../resources/spraying) leaves the finest finish, which is why it is ideal to use on trim. However, with interior-painting,
spraying can require a lot [masking](../../resources/glossary#masking) which can make it impractical. In these cases, I will resort
to brushing and rolling.

My application process guarantees no [flashing](../../resources/glossary#flashing).

For more information on spraying, see [here](../../resources/spraying).

Once the painting is complete, I remove all garbage created during the process, pack up my equipment,
and generally try to leave place better looking then when I arrived.
