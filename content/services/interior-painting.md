<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

No paint will perform correctly unless the proper steps are taken
to prepare the surface before application. This process is called
**prep**. Interior-painting *prep* is a little more involved then its
exterior counterpart due to the fact that interior surfaces are
generally much smoother then exterior ones, thus a larger set of
imperfections in the surface must be dealt with to avoid them
becoming accentuated by a fresh coat of paint.

1. All surfaces are **cleaned**
2. All loose paint is **scraped** and removed. 
3. All dents and nailholes are **spacked** 
4. All rough surfaces are **sanded**.
5. All cracks are **caulked**. 
6. All dust is **vacuumed**.
7. All surfaces requiring primer are **primed**.
