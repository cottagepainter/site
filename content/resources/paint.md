The term **paint** has become convoluted due to the terminology
used by 'paint'-manufactures in their marketing. People
use the word 'paint' for anything that you can put on with a brush,
hence the verb 'to paint'. The problem is that the 'paint'-industry
uses the word 'paint' for a class of its products. It's like a
restaurant replacing the word 'entree' with 'food'. As a consequence,
people end up calling different things 'paint', even thou they might
differ greatly in function.

To solve this conundrum, I introduce my own definition:

<div class="definition">
A <b>paint</b> is a liquid which can be applied to a surface to achieve a goal
</div>

This definition is very broad, but it has a number of advantages:

1. It captures what people really mean when they say 'paint'
2. It is compatible with the verb 'to paint'
3. It allows us to distinguish between different paints without using the same words.
	* In more technical language, it avoids calling a subclass by the name of its superclass.

From here, we make the following classification:

* [Paints](#top-of-page)
	* [Top-coats](#top-coats)
		* [Layers](#layers)
		* [Stains](#stains)
	* [Under-coats](#under-coats)
		* [Primers](#primers)

{{< headerlink level="2" id="top-coats" parent="top-of-page" title="Top-Coats" >}}

<div class="definition">
The outermost layer of paint on a surface
</div>

In other words, a top-coat is what you see when the paint-job is finished. This is what the customer instructs
the painter to use. 

The purpose of all [preparation](../../services/exterior-painting#preparation) done during a paint job is to prepare the surface for the top-coat.

{{< headerlink level="3" id="layers" parent="top-coats" title="Layers" >}}

<div class="definition">
A paint which creates a layer on top of the surface
</div>

This is the class of products the industry calls 'paint'. I've introduced the term 'layer' because that is precisely what
they do, create layers.

Layers will generally have properties associated with aesthetics: consistent sheen, correct color, as well as
the durability to maintain those properties for as long as possible.

{{< headerlink level="4" id="solid-color-stains" parent="layers" title="Solid-Color Stains" >}}

Sadly, this class of paints is also home to what are called
*solid-color stains*. The fact of the matter is, they don't stain
at all, they are a layering paint. The reason the industry
uses this word is because the layers they create are very thin so that the
underlying texture, usually wood, is visible after drying.[^1] Thus,
solid-color stains have some of the functionality of [stains](#stains)
(accentuating existing texture), but bind like layers.

{{< headerlink level="3" id="stains" parent="top-coats" title="Stains" >}} 

<div class="definition">
A paint which penetrates the surface
</div>

True to their names, stains do exactly that, stain. Typically they are used to protect surfaces (like decks),
accentuate existing texture, or add vibrancy.

{{< headerlink level="2" id="under-coats" parent="top-of-page" title="Under-Coats" >}}

<div class="definition">
A paint which prepares a surface for a <a href="#top-coat">top-coat</a>
</div>

{{< headerlink level="3" id="primers" parent="top-of-page" title="Primers" >}}

Technically, a primer is just another word for [under-coat](#under-coat).
However we will hijack the term to make the distinction between under-coats meant for residential use, and the rest:

<div class="definition">
A <b>primer</b> is an under-coat intended for residential use.
</div>

Primers are typically employed to promote adhesion,
prevent absorption by the top-coat of any material on the surface,
and to give corrosion resistance over metals [^2].
