After a couple years of testing, I've decided that [Big
Stretch](https://www.sashco.com/products/big-stretch/) is the only
[caulk](../glossary#caulking) worth using. Although it is expensive (~$6.00 a tube), it
works where the others failed. This is especially true on the Bay,
where buildings are normally old, wooden, and very exposed.

* [24-ft Werner Aluminum Extension Ladder](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/werner-aluminum-extension-ladder-grade-2-225-lb-load-capacity-24-feet/1000715775)
* [8-ft Werner Fiberglass Stepladder](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/werner-fibreglass-stepladder-grade-1-250-lb-load-capacity-8-feet/1000719311).

I use a combination of **tape**, **paper**, and **drop clothes**.

For *tape*, I use [3M
2020](https://www.staples.ca/en/3M-2020-General-Purpose-Masking-Tape-18-mm-x-55-m/product_393266_1-CA_1_20001)
for general-use, and [Green
Frogtape](https://www.frogtape.com/products/multi-surface-painters-tape-green-141-in-x-60-yd)
for preventing paint-bleeds and getting ultra-sharp lines. For my
general-purpose tape, I use 1' and 1.5' widths, for frogtape I only
use 1'.

For paper, I use [9' Masking
Paper](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Trimaco-Easy-Mask-9-in-x-180-ft-Brown-General-Purpose-Paper-12909/202040754?MERCH=REC-_-PIPHorizontal2_rr-_-100089687-_-202040754-_-N)
and a [3M
Hand-Masker](https://www.homedepot.com/p/3M-Hand-Masker-Dispenser-M3000/100089687)
to apply it. Masking paper is used anywhere a painted surface and
a non-painted surface intersect (like the body of the house with the
deck).

Finally, [drop
clothes](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/bennett-14-feet-x-12-feet-cotton-drop-cloth/1000839581)
are used to cover large areas.

I use [3M Spackle + Primer](https://www.amazon.ca/3M-PPP-8-CAP-12CA-Primer-Spackling-Compound/dp/B076LYJ3X2/ref=asc_df_B076LYJ3X2/?tag=googleshopc0c-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=337222756688&hvpos=1o3&hvnetw=g&hvrand=2120482858706542039&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9000397&hvtargid=pla-718406863397&psc=1). It is the only spackle that I know of which doesn't require priming
after it's dry.

{{< headerlink level="2" id="spraying" parent="top-of-page" title="Spraying" >}}

I use an [airless
sprayer](https://www.amazon.ca/HomeRight-C800879-Power-Flo-Airless-Sprayers/dp/B008HP25IK), a [Wagner GX06 2-Finger Gun](https://www.gleempaint.com/gxwagspraygu.html), [Titan hose](https://www.titantool.com/products/accessory-detail/airless-hoses-1/), and variety of [Titan tips](https://www.titantool.com/products/accessories/airless-tips/).

I generally use a [515 Titan HEA tip](https://www.titantool.com/products/accessory-detail/tr1-high-efficiency-airless-tip/) to
spray the body of the house. For the trim, windows, and doors I will generally use a [310 Titan Fine Finishing Tip](https://www.titantool.com/products/accessory-detail/tr1-high-efficiency-airless-Tip/). However I carry a wide range of tip sizes with me at all times
to be ready for any situation.

{{< headerlink level="2" id="washing" parent="top-of-page" title="Washing" >}}

For pressure washing I use a [Simpson MegaShot 2700 PSI Pressure Washer](https://www.pressurewashersdirect.com/Simpson-MSV2723-S-Pressure-Washer/p13326.html), a [Simpson Turbo Nozzle](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00SH900YC/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_5?smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB&psc=1), 100-ft of [Canpump Hose](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00KRLGBFK/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_9?smid=AI1KV6T7NZ526&psc=1), and [Powerfit Extension Wands](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/cart/view.html?ie=UTF8&ref_=nav_crt_ewc_hd).

For interior wall cleaning, I simply use a sponge, hot water, and [Dawn Dishsoap](https://dawn-dish.com/en-us).
