{{< headerlink level="2" id="caulking" parent="top-of-page" title="Caulking" >}}

<div class="definition">
The process of applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caulk">caulk</a>
</div>

**Caulk** is used to seal gaps and seems between intersecting
surfaces (baseboards|walls, trim|walls, ...). Thus, caulking not
only helps to insulate your buildings, but is also an important aesthetic process.

{{< headerlink level="2" id="flashing" parent="top-of-page" title="Flashing" >}}

<div class="definition">
The phenomena of light interacting with a surface of inconsistent <a href="#sheen">sheen</a>
</div>

Light interacting differently with different parts of the same
surface creates a discrepancy in it's visual experience. Depending
on the amount and direction of the light, flashing can be very
[noticible](https://www.google.ca/?gws_rd=ssl#q=paint flashing&tbm=isch).

Flashing is mitigated by proper
[preparation](../../services/interior-painting#preparation) and
[application](../../services/interior-painting#application), and
by using a high-quality paint.

Proper preparation creates a uniform surface for the paint to bond
and react with. Proper application ensures that the paint is allowed
to dry uniformly across the surface. A high-quality paint will
generally have a more consistent dry time and has a tendency to
'gel-out' while drying, leaving a more uniform distribution of
paint across the surface once dry.

{{< headerlink level="2" id="glazing" parent="top-of-page" title="Glazing" >}}

<div class="definition">
The process of applying <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Bondo-Glazing-Spot-Putty-4-5oz/dp/B0002JM8PY/ref=asc_df_B0002JM8PY/?tag=googleshopc0c-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=292955557909&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12717149655573090518&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9000397&hvtargid=pla-435686733984&psc=1">glaze</a>
</div>

**Glaze** is used to remove dents on surfaces that need to be very smooth (like trim).

{{< headerlink level="2" id="masking" parent="top-of-page" title="Masking" >}}

<div class="definition">
The process of protecting surfaces from paint
</div>

See [here](../equipment#masking) for the list of equipment that I use to mask.

{{< headerlink level="2" id="paint" parent="top-of-page" title="Paint" >}}

<div class="definition">
A liquid which can be applied to a surface to achieve a goal
</div>

{{< headerlink level="2" id="prep" parent="top-of-page" title="Prep" >}}

<div class="definition">
Short for preparation, the process which prepares a surface for paint
</div>

{{< headerlink level="2" id="primer" parent="top-of-page" title="Primer" >}}

<div class="definition">
Another word for <a href="#under-coat">under-coat</a>
</div>

{{< headerlink level="2" id="sheen" parent="top-of-page" title="Sheen" >}}

<div class="definition">
Rough measure of the glossiness of a paint finish
</div>

The paint industry has invented a myriad of terms to classify levels of sheen. Here is a list of the most common, from
lowest to highest sheen. 

* Matte/Flat
* Eggshell
* Satin
* Semi-Gloss
* Gloss

The norm today is to put a semi-gloss on trim and doors, eggshell on walls, and flat on the ceiling.

{{< headerlink level="2" id="spackling" parent="top-of-page" title="Spackling" >}}

<div class="definition">
The process of applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spackling_paste">spackle</a>
</div>

**Spackle** is used to fill tiny holes and cracks in a surface. It is primary used on trim to fill in nail holes and
seams between intersecting boards.

Spackling is an aesthetic process.

{{< headerlink level="2" id="top-coat" parent="top-of-page" title="Top-Coat" >}}

<div class="definition">
The outermost layer of paint on a surface
</div>

The top-coat is what you want to see at the end of a paint job. Generally, the top-coat dries to a some consistent
sheen, is durable, and covers well in the chosen color.

{{< headerlink level="2" id="under-coat" parent="top-of-page" title="Under-Coat" >}}

<div class="definition">
A paint which prepares a surface for a <a href="#top-coat">top-coat</a>
</div>

Under-coats are concerned with creating uniformity in a surface so that a top-coat can behave the same
everywhere. Covering up stains, filling in pours, creating a bondable surface, etc..., are all jobs for under-coats.

Another word for under-coat is [primer](#primer).
