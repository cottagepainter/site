My name is Currie Carmichael, I'm a professional painter who's
been serving the SSCA for the past 4 years.  I specialize in
exterior-repaints of wood and composite-sided houses and buildings.
I have been a cottager in the area my entire life and am prepared,
equipped, and ready to handle any project on the Bay.

My season generally lasts from mid-May until September. I primarily
focus on exterior-work during this time. Although this is the case,
I am more then capable of handling your interior projects.

I offer, for every service, a firm, quoted price. I believe this
is the fairest structure for both parties. The customer gets the
security of knowing the cost before committing (and thus
the ability to haggle or shop elsewhere), and I charge the amount
that I think the job is worth. Personally, I find charging
by the hour to be undignified.

If you have any doubts about my competence, I've included, on this
website, my list of [references](/references) for you to consult.
[This list](/references) contains a reference for each of my past
clients. This is because I am confident that every job I have
undertaken has been completed correctly and professionally.

Feel free to [contact](/contact) me anytime. I do not charge for
estimations.
